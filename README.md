<!-- # Ticketi Tamasha

Ticketi Tamasha  event ticketing system is an online platform that allows users to browse, purchase and manage tickets for various events such as concerts, conferences, sports games, festivals, and more.

*User registration and account management: Users can create an account, edit their profile, and manage their ticket orders.

*Event listing and management: Event organizers can list and manage their events, including details such as date, time, venue, pricing, seating options, and availability of tickets.

*Ticket purchasing: Customers can browse and purchase tickets for events, choose their seats, and make payments through the platform. The system should support multiple payment options such as credit card, debit card, PayPal, and other popular payment gateways.
